# Track Editor Overhaul
A ROBOBEAT Demo mod that overhauls the track editor.

## Installing
> These are instructions for setting up the game to **install** the mod. If you want to set up the game for contributing, head to the [Contributing](#contributing) tab.
To install the mod, you need:
- A [copy of ROBOBEAT Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456760/ROBOBEAT/) (ROBOBEAT will be supported on release)
- A [copy of BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
- A [copy of the mod](https://github.com/ZaddikDev/TrackEditorOverhaul/releases)

After obtaining all of the requirements above, you first need to install BepInEx into the ROBOBEAT Demo folder. To do that, I would recommend checking out [this article](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html).
After installing it, you need to run the game at least once to generate configuration files and folders.
Finally, you have to add the mod copy into BepInEx's plugin folder (BepInEx/plugins). To do that, simply copy the downloaded DLL (probably named TrackEditorOverhaul.dll) to said folder.

### Congratulations! You have successfully installed the mod.
